      The client was looking for a clickable prototype which opens up the patientâ€™s personal information, the medical
      history, current condition etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking out the design into smaller projects like collection of information from the customer, addressing his/her
      needs and giving a solution and integrating them to achieve the final goal was the challenge.

      Initially we had few rounds of discussion with the client to understand their existing application. We also came
      up with few suggestions which, we felt ,may add to their goal.

      We designed the screens with Angular JS and also took care of the usability and design aspect of the web pages.

                        <p>
                            The company had an existing web application that worked fine and allowed them to talk about their work, but they wanted to refactor and improve it. As there were a number of drawbacks, such as the user experience being unfriendly, the UI being unappealing,
                            the application's loading time being lengthy, and the code used being inefficient, all of this resulted in poor performance and a negative user experience. As a result, the company decided to redesign the entire web application.

                        <p>
                            The application was slow, the app's size and loading time appeared to be enormous, and everything was done in a single module. Despite being an Angular Application, the majority of the code was written in JQuery and JavaScript. Because JQuery is considered
                            an outdated framework, the entire code had to be refactored. 90% of the JQuery code was converted to pure Angular and TypeScript code.

                        <p>
                            All existing issues were resolved as we revamped the application. The frameworks used to write optimized code also improved efficiency. We divided the application into modules to improve its capability and usability. We assisted the company in developing
                            the website as well as the admin panel. All HR compliances, as well as an appointment booking feature, were included in the admin panel. Users saved a lot of internet time because the entire website was refactored, and the
                            application's performance improved significantly. We also improved the User Experience, and the web application is now more aesthetically appealing.
