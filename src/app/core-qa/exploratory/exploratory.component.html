          As rightly said above we at Test Yantra focus on different aspects of the code and this is possible through
          Exploratory Testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the Test Approach which helps to discover, analyze, with proofs all the possible ways of
          achieving Quality of a Software / an Application irrespective of the kind of application it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also to note every Test beings with Exploratory Testing and every QA in Test Yantra starts his testing with
          Exploratory Testing.

            Main benefit what we found in doing Exploratory testing is that it requires a minimal amount of planning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Testers continuously decide for their next step of testing, and the decision depends upon the tester’s
            thought process.
          </li>
          <li>
            It helps to provide feedback to developers as soon as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            A larger number of bugs or defects can be uncovered using this way of testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            A larger group of the resource such as a developer, tester, BA, Designers perform ET as there are no
            scripted test cases and each test case leads to a different perspective.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exploratory testing helps in exploring critical issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of Iterative coding of an application, ET focuses on testing new hallmarks while automation
            does Regression and Backward compatibility testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of Iterative coding style for an application, ET mainly focuses on test in hallmarks while
            automation does follow a regression and backward compatibility testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of unstable requirement, ET helps in testing the new environment within a limited time and
            this is proven very beneficial to our End customers as well as to us.
