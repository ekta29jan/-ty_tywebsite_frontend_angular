                    A full-stack developer can build both client and server software. A full-stack developer is accountable for all aspects relevant to the front-end, back-end, database, and eventually the integration process. As a full-stack software engineer, it is necessary
                    to handle the programming, the server-side API, coding languages for back-end development, executing the client-side of the app using JavaScript, querying databases, and working with version control systems.
