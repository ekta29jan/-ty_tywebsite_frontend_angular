    <div><strong>Functional Testing: </strong></div>
    <p>
      Testing in CSPs must encompass diverse Operating Systems, Devices and Channels. With functional testing covering
      multiple scenarios early in the release cycle, we are able to help our customers shift-left and eliminate defects
      early in the lifecycle resulting in a stable system across releases.

        <div><strong>Automation Testing: </strong></div>
        <p>
          Our extensive experience of delivering Test automation for market leading customers enable us to prioritize
          business scenarios that are repetitive in nature and automate them early. This helps customers to achieve
          optimal regression test automation to deliver stable builds release after release.
        </p>
        <div><strong>Usability Testing:</strong></div>
        <p>
          User Experience across channels is most critical for CSPs to derive greater Return on Investment and improve
          Customer satisfaction across their deployed solutions. Our QA processes are focused to ensure UI & UX testing
          is performed to detect defects early, ensure accuracy of results, evaluate user experience and improve web
          site quality and readability.

    <div><strong>Webservices/API Testing:</strong></div>
    <p>
      Complex architecture, multiple channels with large systems including rich user interface aimed at delivering best
      in class customer experience and operational parameters make CSP ecosystem one of the most complex in the world.
      Testing of the APIs that are used to communicate between business applications hence becomes critical. Integration
      testing including API validation is used to determine whether expectations for functionality, performance, and
      security are met. Automation of API testing ensures turn around time to test APIs and associated defect fixes are
      far lesser compared to manual effort while eliminating human errors.
    </p>
    <div><strong>Regression Testing:</strong></div>
    <p>
      We conduct regression testing with a detailed traceability matrix, a dependency analysis, a check between current
      and previous releases, a risk-based analysis that includes FMEA, output from code coverage, etc., and a continuous
      pruning that helps by removing obsolete test cases.
    </p>
    <div><strong>Testing Center of Excellence:</strong></div>
    <p>
      A Testing Center of Excellence (TCoE) greatly aids in introducing standards, testing processes, using test tools,
      and test methods specific to testing in the Communications industry. We have the necessary proficiency and a
      decade-long experience of testing for the Communications industry. Our all-inclusive TCoE package for telecom is
      based on a reliable framework that enables organizations to scale up their businesses and process.
